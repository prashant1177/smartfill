### ➤ Step 4: Enjoy Autofill on Any Form

Whenever you open a page with a form:

### ✋ Optional: Use "Click to Fill" Mode (Permission-Based)

You can set SmartFill to only **autofill when clicked** instead of automatic:
- Gives you more control
- No data is filled unless you approve
- Perfect for privacy-focused users

All saved information is stored locally using Chrome's `storage.sync` API — secure, private, and only accessible by you.
